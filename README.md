# Friimu

"The story so far:
In the beginning, the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

But fear not, for amidst the cosmic chaos, there is a tiny, insignificant blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms have created something that might just make the whole thing worthwhile. Almost.

Welcome to **Friimu**, a mostly harmless web app for playing free games. It's a place where you can distract yourself from the impending heat death of the universe, or the fact that your digital watch still thinks digital watches are a pretty neat idea.

## What is it?

Friimu is what you get when you have a brilliant idea, but you're stuck in traffic on a Thursday afternoon. Itâ€™s a digital playground, a pan-galactic gargle blaster for your browser, a towel for your travels through the internet. In short, it's a website with free games. No strings, no fees, no Vogons. We promise.

## Where is it?

Right here, you frood: [https://friimu.app](https://friimu.app)

It's probably not The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, but the entertainment is arguably better, and you don't have to worry about the temporal paradoxes.

## So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!

Enjoy the games. And whatever you do, don't panic.
